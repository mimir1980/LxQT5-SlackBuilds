## Slackware 14.1 Notes ##
##########################

I got Lxqt working on Slackware-14.1

You need to upgrade the following packages from current prior to installing Qt5.

libxcb
xcb-proto
xcb-util-curser
xcb-util-renderutil
xcb-util-wm

If you have Multilib setup like I do upgrade the libxcb package with the one
from the Slackware current Mulitlib.
