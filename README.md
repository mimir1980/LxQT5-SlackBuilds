LxQt-SlackBuilds
=================

SlackBuilds of mine for Qt5 version of LxQt
These are for Slackware Current as of 1/12/2015

There are Build-Deps.sh & Build-Main.sh scripts inspired by and 
modded from the msb project. Run Build-Deps first.

The Build-Main.sh script lacks checking for sources on purpose as all
of those SlackBuilds check for the source themselves.

Will be left in Master until next Slackware Release =]
