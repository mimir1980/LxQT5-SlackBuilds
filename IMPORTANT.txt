LxQt Built against Qt5

I obtained the tarballs from Github. You'll need to get them yourself.
Just get the newest version, they will almost all be version 0.8.0 as of Jan 03 2015

Will likely Set the scripts up to download the source in the near future.

These programs don't specify -qt5, I add it as a reminder
that they are compiled against Qt5 and not Qt4, which I don't
even have installed on this machine.

Will Be removing the added qt5 tag as I update the SlackBuilds

libxcb is too old in 14.1 (Or maybe it just hates me)

On Slackware 14.1 upgrade the libxcb package before compiling Qt5
