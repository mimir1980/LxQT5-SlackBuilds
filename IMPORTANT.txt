LxQt Built against Qt5 for Slackware Linux Current

libxcb is too old in 14.1 

Removed qt5, you'll need to get it yourself, there is a build at SBo.
I highly reccomend compiling it from source and not using someone elses
premade package for Slackware. Qt5 seems to be very picky about the
dependancies it's compiled against. Make sure current is up to date 
with patches/upgrades before compiling Qt5.

If compiled against Qt 5.4.x you will have to log out and back in
upon changing the theme in LxQt. This is being worked on in the master
branch but these are for version 0.8.0. Qt 5.3.x doesn't have this
issue from what I hear. I am using Qt 5.4.0
