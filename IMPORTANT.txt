LxQt Built against Qt5

I obtained the tarballs from Github. You'll need to get them yourself.
Just get the newest version, they will almost all be version 0.8.0 as of Jan 03 2015

Will likely Set the scripts up to download the source in the near future.

These programs don't specify -qt5, I add it as a reminder
that they are compiled against Qt5 and not Qt4, which I don't
even have installed on this machine.

Install with installpkg (not sure if this naming scheme will work 
with upgradepkg --install-new )

Slackware-current! libxcb is too old in 14.1 (Or maybe it just hates me)
[lxqt-panel] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
