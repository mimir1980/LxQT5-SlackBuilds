# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

compton:
compton: Compton is a compositor for X, and a fork of xcompmgr-dana.
compton: I was frustrated by the low amount of standalone lightweight
compton: compositors. Compton was forked from Dana Jansens' fork of
compton: xcompmgr and refactored. I fixed whatever bug I found, and added
compton: features I wanted. Things seem stable, but don't quote me on
compton: it. I will most likely be actively working on this until I get the
compton: features I want. This is also a learning experience for me. That is,
compton: I'm partially doing this out of a desire to learn Xlib.
