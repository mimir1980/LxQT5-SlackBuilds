# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kwindowsystem:
kwindowsystem: Convenience access to certain properties and features of the
kwindowsystem: windowing system.  KWindowSystem provides information about
kwindowsystem: the windowing system and allows interaction with the windowing
kwindowsystem: system. It provides an high level API which is windowing system
kwindowsystem: independent and has platform specific implementations. This API
kwindowsystem: is inspired by X11 and thus not all functionality is available
kwindowsystem: on all windowing systems.  In addition to the high level API,
kwindowsystem: this framework also provides several more low level classes for
kwindowsystem: interaction with the X Windowing System.
