# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

system-tools-backends:
system-tools-backends: The System Tools Backends are a set of cross-platform modules for
system-tools-backends: Linux, FreeBSD and other Unix systems. The backends provide an
system-tools-backends: common DBus interface to all platforms to modify or read the system
system-tools-backends: configuration in a distro independent fashion. Historically, access
system-tools-backends: to system configuration has varied deeply across Unix flavours,
system-tools-backends: and concreting a bit more, across Linux distributions, making it
system-tools-backends: near impossible to write desktop tools that could work flawlessly
system-tools-backends: in a cross-platform way.
