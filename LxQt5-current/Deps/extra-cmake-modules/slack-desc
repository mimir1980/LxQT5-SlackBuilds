# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

extra-cmake-modules:
extra-cmake-modules: The Extra CMake Modules package, or ECM, adds to the modules provided
extra-cmake-modules: by CMake, including both ones used by find_package() to find common
extra-cmake-modules: software and ones that can be used directly in CMakeLists.txt
extra-cmake-modules: files to perform common tasks.  In addition, it provides common
extra-cmake-modules: build settings used in software produced by the KDE community.
extra-cmake-modules: While the driving force of this module is to reduce duplication in
extra-cmake-modules: CMake scripts across KDE software, it is intended to be useful for
extra-cmake-modules: any software that uses the CMake build system.
