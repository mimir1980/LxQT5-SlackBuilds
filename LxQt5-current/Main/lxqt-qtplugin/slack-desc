# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lxqt-qtplugin: lxqt-qtplugin (LXDE-Qt system integration plugin for Qt)
lxqt-qtplugin:
lxqt-qtplugin: With this plugin, all Qt-based programs can adopt settings of
lxqt-qtplugin: LXDE-Qt, such as the icon theme.  The plugin for Qt5 is in the
lxqt-qtplugin: qt5 sub directory. To use the plugin in Qt 5, we have to export
lxqt-qtplugin: the environment variable QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=lxqt. Then every Qt5
lxqt-qtplugin: program can load the theme plugin.
