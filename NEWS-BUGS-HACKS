I forgot to make a xinitrc for LxQt, I will add it as soon as I update the build script.

If you use a session manager to log in, if you change a system theme or your settings and you log out and then
back in, openbox may not start and you won't have a window manager. A quick hack/fix for this is to edit your
lxqt.desktop file and have it exec the xinitrc instead of the lxqt session.

    Exec=/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.lxqt   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
