I forgot to make a xinitrc for LxQt, I will add it as soon as I update the build script.

If you use a session manager to log in, if you change a system theme or your settings and you log out and then
back in, openbox may not start and you won't have a window manager and have to reboot. I log in through the linux console
using a xinitrc and don't have this problem.
